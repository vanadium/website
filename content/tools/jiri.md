`jiri` is a command-line tool for managing multi-repository projects. `jiri` was
originally designed to aid Vanadium development, but has since been extracted
into a standalone project, and is now used by various other projects.

`jiri` is available here: https://github.com/vanadium/go.jiri

The "fetch repositories" step of [Vanadium installation](/installation/)
installs the `jiri` tool in `$JIRI_ROOT/devtools/bin`.

Run `jiri help` to learn more about the tool. (Note, this command assumes your
`PATH` contains `$JIRI_ROOT/devtools/bin`.)
